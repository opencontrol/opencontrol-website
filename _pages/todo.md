# OpenControl: ToDo

- Think about report generation - convert templates to Templates.
https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates-3/

-  We need to write a "getting started" tutorial. As a quick bootstrap, use the
tutorial on the Concourse.ci website, and then checkout the example pipeline.

- Support other frameworks
   - FedRAMP High?
   - HIPAA?
   - ICD-503?
   - SOX?
