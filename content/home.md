tagline: OpenControl
intro: |
  <h2>It's a schema</h2>
  By adopting a standard approach to documenting "controls" (whether Technical Operational, or Management) we can
  rapidly build a community of vendors and operators. You can see [the current (and evolving) OpenControl schema here](https://github.com/opencontrol/schemas).

  <h2>It's a Set of Tools and Practices</h2>
  Right now we're excited about [Masonry](https://github.com/opencontrol/compliance-masonry), a tool to parse OpenControl-formatted content.

  <h2>It's a Community</h2>
  This community includes vendors that provide documentation of controls in a standard schema, government agencies and other regulators that document certifications in another schema, and operators who use the OpenControl process to authorized their systems. You can see a [list of current members here](community/).
